This upcoming Friday, we would love for you to solicit your support
towards testing and contributing to the process of qualifying a new
alpha-release version of Firefox for Android on the Aurora channel as
part of our rapid release testing cycle. We will be focusing on the
process of [discovering][], installing, managing and using [web
applications ][]inside of Firefox for Android.

This event is open to **all** those interested: newcomers, experienced
testers, developers, and anyone interested in testing and using Firefox
on Android.

We would like for you to use the new version of Firefox on your Android
phone, and take a close look at the latest Aurora product in order to
assist us in identifying any noticeably major issues found, and ensure
that all feature functionality that is included in this upcoming release
is on its way to a feature and testing complete state with the added
emphasis on discovering and using [web applications][web applications ].

To cover the work throughout the whole day we have created
an [EtherPad][] test-plan. Please feel free to read and use it as a
companion during the testday event. There will be moderators at hand in
the IRC channel: [\#testday][], to answer any questions you have.

Together with your help we want to make this testday a success and
ensure the high quality of Firefox for Android for mobile devices for
all of our users world-wide. If you have time on Friday August 24th,
2012, please join us on IRC, we will have Mozilla community and testers
on hand to help answer any of your questions.

Your testing and feedback is **highly valuable**, and we hope to see you
attend our test day event.
