This upcoming Friday, we would love for you to solicit your support towards testing and contributing to the process of qualifying a new developer-release version of Firefox for Android and Firefox on Desktop both on the [Nightly] channel as part of our rapid release testing cycle. We will be focusing on the process of discovering, using and testing [WebRTC].

WebRTC is a free, open project that enables web browsers with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple Javascript APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose. The WebRTC mission is to enable rich, high quality, RTC applications to be developed in the browser via simple Javascript APIs and HTML5. The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera.

This QA event, this Friday, is open to **all** those interested: newcomers, experienced testers, developers, and anyone interested in testing early builds of Firefox on the Nightly channel.

We would like for you to use the new version of Firefox on your Android phone and desktop or laptop machine, and take a close look at the latest Nightly builds in order to assist us in identifying any noticeably major issues found with our [WebRTC] implementation, and ensure that all feature functionality that is included in this upcoming release is on its way to a feature and testing complete state.

To cover the work throughout the whole day we have created
an [EtherPad][] test-plan. Please feel free to read and use it as a companion during the day's event. There will be moderators at hand in the IRC channel: [\#testday][], to answer any questions you have.

Together with your help we want to make this event a success and ensure the high quality of WebRTC support in Firefox for all of our users world-wide. If you have time on Friday June 21st, 2013, please join us on IRC, we will have Mozilla community and testers on hand to help answer any of your questions.

Your testing and feedback is **highly valuable**, and we hope to see you attend our test day event.
