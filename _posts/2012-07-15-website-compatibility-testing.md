title: Firefox for Android - Website Compatibility Testing
---

Firefox for Android Testers,

Website compatibility testing will be a covered and focused area as part
of the release testing process for Firefox for Android 15.0, and we want
you to help us during our testing cycle.

We want you to use Firefox on Android (on the [Aurora][]) channel to
assist us in identifying any noticeably major issues found in websites.
Issues can range from pages that do not look right due to layout and
positioning problems to interactivity and font related issues. We are
also looking for testing around top-sites to identify areas where
content served to Firefox differs from other mobile browsers.

How you can help us?

-   Download [Aurora][] for Android
-   Run the [website compatiblity testing tool][]
-   File issues found on [Bugzilla][] 
-   [Join our website compatiblity testing and evangelism mailing
    list][]
-   Join us on [IRC][] in the \#mobile and \#qa channels

Bringing a better Firefox to Android will guide us all towards
fulfilling Mozillaâ€™s [mission][] of providing access to one Web that
everyone can access, regardless of device or location.
