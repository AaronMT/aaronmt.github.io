title: Site Compatibility Testing for Firefox for Android
---

The Mozilla Developer Network has recently accepted an excellent
informational article written by Jason Smith, Lawrence Mandel, and Janet
Swisher essentially entailing the largely problematic issue of browser
and content compatibility with the mobile web. If you are interested in
site testing for Firefox for Android, please give the article a read;
and help us improve the web. Let us know if you have any questions about
compatibility testing or want to become involved in Mozillaâ€™s mobile web
compatibility effort, please sign up for the
compatibility@lists.mozilla.org mailing list.
